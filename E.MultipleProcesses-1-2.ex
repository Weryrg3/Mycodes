# ➤ Exercise: WorkingWithMultipleProcesses-1
# Run this code on your machine. See if you get comparable results.

# ➤ Exercise: WorkingWithMultipleProcesses-2
# Write a program that spawns two processes and then passes each a unique
# token (for example, “fred” and “betty”). Have them send the tokens back.
# – Is the order in which the replies are received deterministic in theory?
# In practice?
# – If either answer is no, how could you make it so?
